# 🏆 National High School Exam Score Analysis (using HCMC data)

## 📖 Overview
This project is a **Python-based data analysis and visualization tool** designed to analyze the National High School Exam scores using a dataset from **Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC)** in 2 years 2023 and 2024. The main goal is to process and visualize the data effectively, providing insights into **student performance patterns, statistical distributions,** and trends that can aid educators and policymakers, analysis and compare between 2 years.

## 📁 Project Structure
The project is organized into several main files and directories:

- **`Main.py`**: 🟢 Initiates data processing and visualization, converting string data to float values for accurate analysis.
- **`CRUD.py`**: 🔄 Provides functions for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, enabling efficient data management.
- **`dataProcess`**: 📂 Contains sample data files and essential data processing code (e.g., handling missing values and normalizing data).
- **`UI.py`**: 🖥 Implements a user interface, allowing easy interaction with the dataset, viewing results, and exploring specific data points.
- **`data_visualization.py`**: 📊 Creates plots and exports statistical data, allowing users to visually interpret distributions and trends.
- **`diem_hoc_sinh_test.csv`**: 📋 Test CSV file containing sample exam scores, used for testing data processing functions and visualizations.

## ✨ Key Features
1. **Data Processing**: 
   - Processes raw exam score data, including converting string data to numeric formats for accurate statistical calculations.
   - Handles missing values and normalizes data entries for consistency.

2. **Data Visualization**: 
   - Generates graphs to visualize data distributions and trends, identifying patterns and anomalies.
   - Outputs statistical summaries to provide insights into the exam scores.

3. **CRUD Functionality**:
   - Allows users to modify the dataset directly from the interface, making it easier to update or correct data as needed.

4. **User Interface (UI)**:
   - A graphical interface to interact with the dataset, display analysis results, and generate visualizations on demand.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `Main.py` to start the console program.
3. Run `UI.py` to start the program by GUI.
4. Use the interface (if provided) to load data, perform CRUD operations, and view visualizations.

## 🔧 Future Work
- Add more data processing features, such as correlation analysis with demographic data.
- Enhance the UI for a better user experience.
- Expand data visualization options for more advanced analysis.
